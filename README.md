# Finding-Donors-for-Charity
Finding Donors for Charity About Dataset Every year, 90% of Americans give money to charities. Is such generosity necessarily welfare enhancing for the giver? We present a theoretical framework that distinguishes two types of motivation: individuals like to give, for example, due to altruism or warm glow, and individuals would rather not give but dislike saying no, for example, due to social pressure. We design a door-to-door fund-raiser in which some households are informed about the exact time of solicitation with a flyer on their doorknobs. Thus, they can seek or avoid the fund-raiser. We find that the flyer reduces the share of households opening the door by 9% to 25% and, if the flyer allows checking a Do Not Disturb box, reduces giving by 28% to 42%. The latter decrease is concentrated among donations smaller than  10Thesefindingssuggestthatsocialpressureisanimportantdeterminantofdoor−to−doorgiving.Combiningdatafromthisandacomplementaryfieldexperiment,westructurallyestimatethemodel.Theestimatedsocialpressurecostofsayingnotoasolicitoris 3.80 for an in-state charity and $1.40 for an out-of-state charity.
